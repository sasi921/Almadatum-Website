<p align="justify"><br>Dear Alumni,<br><br>

It is my pleasure to welcome you to the alumni section of our website, where you can feel right at home. In this section, you can be active and engaged members of the community, reconnect with your classmates and keep up to date about alumni events.<br><br>

I am tremendously proud of what you have all been accomplishing since leaving campus, and of how you - and the university - have grown in the past few years. As you continue on your paths, fulfilling your potential and acting as ambassadors for Vignan,  I encourage you to think often on the mission Dr. Lavu Rathaiah set for Vignan's University and for you: to become leaders in the world, promoting peace and hope.<br><br>

We look forward to your continued success.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>

Chairman-Alumni Association<br>
VFSTR.</p>
